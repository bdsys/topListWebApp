*Quick Description: The goal is to create a social website for people to "like" or "dislike" items in specific
catagories that will either raise to the top or drop to the bottom of the "top lists". Users will create accounts
and have friends and groups. Online Merchants can pay a small fee to have a "merchant account" to sell and
display various goods through a specified top list.

*How to find and use application: This will be initally releaesd for internet browsers and eventually with
mobile apps for free.

*Detailed Description: 
	-Product: The Top Lists are tiered from very high level (I.E Top Lists of various top lists) to very specific (I.E: Rims on a specific vehicle). 
The long term sustainable business model is to allow online merchants to set up shop based on this social 
networking platform. 

	-Technology: Top List is a web application project being developed with only front end languages so far.
We are going to branch out to either ASP.NET or PHP for database connectivity and server-side operations. This
Decision will be made by Black Dog Systems at a later time. 

	-Verison Control: We embrace the branch version control by using four branches, as follows:
		-Version Design: V(ersion)A.B.C.D (I.E: V6.2.3.1)
			-Other: Each version has more autority than the one below it (higherarchy is in alphabetical order). As each version increments 
					up, the version control numbers below that will reset to zero. 
					I.E "V3.5" suggests no bugs branch has merged into it, where as "V3.5.2" suggests that two seperate bugs branches has been
					merged since the fifth minor feature release was merged into the third major feature release version of the master branch.
					
						 -A: Major Features release 
							-Branch Name: Major
							-Other: Alpha and Beta will NEVER reach higher than "0" in this catagory as this is preserved for the live production 
								ready application. 
								-Other II: A "Major" feature release is any feature push that contains a largely noticible change to how 
											users experience AND/OR use the web application. This CAN include significant UX and UI 
											graphical changes. This may also include major improvments and feature implementations to 
											already existing feature sets of the product.
							-Example: V1
							
						 -B: Minor Features release 
							Branch: Minor
							Other: A "Minor" release is any feature push that contains a minor to moderately noticible change to how users
								   experience AND/OR use the web application. These changes are most common and can contain any thing except
								   bug fixes. This branch will add flexability and further advance the existing A branch. 
							-Example: V1.1
								   
						 -C: General Bug Fixes
							 Branch: Bugs
							 Other: A "Bugs" release is a push that contains ANY fix to the web application. This includes fixes to any faccet
									of the software from core elements to major and minor features. These branches are to be well thought out and
									released proceedurly. These bugs, while known to be a problem, are NOT bugs that significantly limit the
									functionality of the web application and can wait.
							-Example: V1.1.1
							
						 -D: Hotfixs
							 Branch: Hotfix
							 Other: A "Hotfix" releaes is a push that contains a fix that is significantlt imparing the web application. These are fixes
									that have been released faster than a traditionally planned bug fixes.
							-Example: V1.1.1.1
