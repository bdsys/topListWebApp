*Quick Description: The goal is to create a social website for people to "like" or "dislike" items in specific
catagories that will either raise to the top or drop to the bottom of the "top lists". Users will create accounts
and have friends and groups. Online Merchants can pay a small fee to have a "merchant account" to sell and
display various goods through a specified top list.

*How to find and use application: This will be initally releaesd for internet browsers and eventually with
mobile apps for free.

*Detailed Description: 
	-Product: The Top Lists are tiered from very high level (I.E Top Lists of various top lists) to very specific (I.E: Rims on a specific vehicle). 
The long term sustainable business model is to allow online merchants to set up shop based on this social 
networking platform. 

	-Technology: Top List is a web application project being developed with only front end languages so far.
We are going to branch out to either ASP.NET or PHP for database connectivity and server-side operations. This
Decision will be made by Black Dog Systems at a later time.
